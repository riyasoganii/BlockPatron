Application Information

Background

Crowdfunding is faced with a major problem- accountability. In a lot of cases, there are delays in the transfer of money, and sometimes, the money doesn't reach the recipient altogether! Also, in the case that money is given to a scam campaign, you may never want to donate again. 

With blockchain technology, you know more information. Like who you‚Äôre going to send money to and how they plan to spend the money. On the other hand, the receivers will also receive more support for their projects with lower fees and overall cost, without hefty fees from lawyers. 

There is a high need for crowdfunding for charities and non-profits in particular. This is because people are often hesitant to donate to such organisations as, unlike a solid product, they have no proof to see where their money is really going. Additionally, a crowdfunding application which is centered around charities and nonprofits is yet to be built altogether.

Idea

I aim to build an app where a novice user is able to browse through non-profits/charities filtered on the basis of the causes they wish to support, see all details of that non-profit/charity, including how they will spend the money, and then donate the money in full confidence that it will be used in the right place.

Please start by viewing the user journey flow (download it to view!) to get a better idea of the layout and functioning of the app. Afterwards, you may view the wireframes to get a live demo of the product in use, and then you may view the business plan, to judge its viability.
