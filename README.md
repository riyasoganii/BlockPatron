# BlockPatron

## Background

Donation is faced with a major problem- accountability. 
People are often hesitant to donate to nonprofits as they have no proof to see where their money is really going.
In a lot of cases, there are delays in the transfer of donations, and sometimes, the donation doesn't reach the recipient altogether! 
But, with blockchain technology, you know more information.

## Idea

BlockPatron is an app aimed at bringing donations to various nonprofits and charities. 
But, this isn't your regular crowdfunding app. BlockPatron uses blockchain technology to tackle the biggest problems of modern day crowdfunding, in the following ways:


Better visibility, and more transparency- you'll know exactly where your donation is going, and what it is being used for! 

Better security- your donation won't be stolen!

No extra transaction fees- who needs those?!

No delays- your donation is received instantly!


Thus, I aim to build an app where a novice user is able to browse through nonprofits filtered on the basis of the causes they wish to support, 
see all details of a non-profit with full transparency, and then securely donate their money to the nonprofit as cryptocurrency on blockchain, using fiat on-ramp. 
This donation will be instant, with no external fees.
The user will also be provided with blockchain transaction ID proof of the nonprofit's transactions, 
so they have full confidence that their money is being used in the right place.


BlockPatron will use fiat on-ramp to convert donatins to bitcoin.
