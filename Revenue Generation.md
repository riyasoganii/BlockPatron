# Brief Business plan 

## Revenue generation

1. Nonprofits which have registered themselves on the app have the option to 'sponsor' the application by providing funding (minimum amount TBD on product basis) or by providing a percentage of their donations (>3%). In return, they will be offered a space on the 'featured nonprofits' section on the top of the donations page. This will boost their popularity amongst users.

2. We can start an email newsletter to interested donors in which we create a highlight for 'Nonprofits of the week'. Nonprofits can provide the app with funding (minimum amount TBD) to take a space on that list.

3. All nonprofits which sign up on the app must agree to pay BlockPatron 3% of their total recieved donations. This would still amount to less than the combined transaction fees, legal fees, accounting fees, etc. which they would have had to pay on another app. 

4. When reaching out to investors, the product can speak for itself!

## Expanding reach within app

1. Employees can be offered a commission for every nonprofit they invite to the application.


2. A 'Sign up your own nonprofit today' section is offered to users (donors) themselves, and located on the main page.

3. In advertising campaigns and word of mouth, the technology speaks for itself!;)
